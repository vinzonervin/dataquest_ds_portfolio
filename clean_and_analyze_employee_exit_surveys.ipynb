    "In this project we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland))(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE here.[Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) had prepared the datasets to make them easier to work with.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "  * Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We will be combining the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.  \n",
