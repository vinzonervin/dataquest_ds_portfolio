    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page. He was able to find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.\n",
    "  * In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.\n",
    "  * For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, although we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML."

    "One of the best ways to figure out whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis is to compare the system's characteristics previous and after the analysis. Fortunately, we have ready-made data for both these periods of time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll work with two samples of movie ratings:the data in one sample was collected previous to Hickey's analysis, while the other sample was collected after. Let's start by reading in the two samples (which are stored as CSV files) and getting familiar with their structure."

    "Our goal is to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. The population of interest for our analysis is made of all the movie ratings stored on Fandango's website, regardless of the releasing year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to find out whether the parameters of this population changed after Hickey's analysis, we're interested in sampling the population at two different periods in time — previous and after Hickey's analysis — so we can compare the two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we're working with was sampled at the moments we want: one sample was taken previous to the analysis, and the other after the analysis. We want to describe the population, so we need to make sure that the samples are representative, otherwise we should expect a large sampling error and, ultimately, wrong conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Hickey's article and from the README.md of [the data set's repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango), we can see that he used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "  * The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample — some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md [of the data set's repository](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17)):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",
    "  * The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the README.md or from the data).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This second sample is also subject to temporal trends and it's unlikely to be representative of our population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these authors had certain research questions in mind when they sampled the data, and they used a set of criteria to get a sample that would fit their questions. Their sampling method is called purposive sampling (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us."

    "  * Both distributions are strongly left skewed.\n",
    "  * The 2016 distribution is slightly shifted to the left relative to the 2015 distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The left skew suggests that movies on Fandango are given mostly high and very high fan ratings. Coupled with the fact that Fandango sells tickets, the high ratings are a bit dubious. It'd be really interesting to investigate this further — ideally in a separate project, since this is quite irrelevant for the current goal of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slight left shift of the 2016 distribution is very interesting for our analysis. It shows that ratings were slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that there was a difference indeed between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. We can also see the direction of the difference: the ratings in 2016 were slightly lower compared to 2015."
